The goal of this thesis is to provide a user interface through which users can buy and sell cryptocurrencies. Before starting the trade itself, users will need to identify their identity. After successful identification, users will be enabled to replenish the available funds of the application. Using the funds that will be transferred to the application, the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies will be possible. The prices at which the calculations will be performed will be taken from an external API in order to give a more realistic look to the application itself. In addition, users will also be shown a graph with the respective price history for each cryptocurrency they want to buy at any given time. At the end of the trade, users will be able to withdraw their money from the application if they wish.

### Currently the application has five views:
- User registration form
- User login form
- Home page - consisting of a graph that shows the history of exactly one hundred cryptocurrencies, so that the user can select a given currency and follow the history of the same, as well as the current value. Furthermore, basic information can be seen about the selected cryptocurrency such as market cap and so on. There is also the possibility to perform the following actions via buttons: adding available funds to the application, withdrawing money, buying and selling currencies. 
- View who shows who is the currently logged in user, how much funds they have available as well as a tabular display with all the cryptocurrencies they own.
- A table through which all cryptocurrencies owned by the logged-in user can be seen.
- <b> (ADMIN-ONLY) </b> Table showing all successfully executed transactions in the application.

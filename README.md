# Web Application for Crypto Trading - Graduate Thesis
### Diploma thesis on "Web application for cryptocurrency trading".
### The goal of this thesis is to provide a user interface through which users can buy and sell cryptocurrencies. Before starting the trade itself, users will need to identify their identity. After successful identification, users will be enabled to replenish the available funds of the application. Using the funds that will be transferred to the application, the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies will be possible. The prices at which the calculations will be performed will be taken from an external API in order to give a more realistic look to the application itself. In addition, users will also be shown a graph with the respective price history for each cryptocurrency they want to buy at any given time. At the end of the trade, users will be able to withdraw their money from the application if they wish.

#### Tech stack: Spring Boot - backend, React - frontend.
#### More detailed information coming soon..
